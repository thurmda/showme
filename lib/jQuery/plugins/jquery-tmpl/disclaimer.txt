The code contributions made by Microsoft to the jQuery-tmpl source code, 
on http://github.com/nje/jquery-tmpl, are modifications to the original 
code at http://github.com/jquery/jquery-tmpl written by the jQuery team.  

Thus, Microsoft is contributing solely its modifications to the original 
templating code, as we cannot claim to own the original templating code, 
which belongs to the jQuery team.
